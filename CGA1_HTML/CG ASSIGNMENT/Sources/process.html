Documentation Of Our Journey

As we all know, the most essential and fundamental part of making a movie is coming up with a story to tell, so naturally, that's where we started our process. 
We thought that writing a story is the easy part, and once we come up with a story, the drawing part would be the difficult phase. So, we sat together and discussed 
a bunch of ideas several times; these sessions weren't as productive as we had hoped. Most of those ideas were just bad, and some good ones were stories we remembered 
from somewhere else. We looked up on google how to write stories; we read some famous short stories; we also watched a few short films for story inspiration.
We even tried remembering stories we studied in our primary school English class, but we couldn't form a solid story; we managed to get some ideas, but they were just
ideas, and we could not make a properly structured and complete story out of them. It was pretty late when we finally realised that coming up with an original
story is pretty tricky, definitely tougher than we thought it would be. After many hours of thinking of several people, we finally decided on a good story set during 
the period of world war two, and we are pretty happy with it. So, we started drawing the storyboards; first, we planned out all the beats of the story and the different 
shots that we should be drawing. 
</p>
<p>
We tried several drawing and storyboarding programmes we stuck with a drawing application that is given in the Samsung tab that we used to draw all the sketches. 
The application we used is Clip Studio Paint; we used the six-month free trial offered with the galaxy tab. 
This software provided all the tools we could ever ask for and made our life substantially easy.

When we started drawing, we realised that depicting several intricate aspects of our story in a storyboard was beyond our technical capabilities and that we were 
quickly running out of resources.The image below was our first idea but we did not do it because we had to draw so much.

So, we started looking for another story idea; this time, ease of drawing was one of our consideration criteria. After a few more 
hours of severe thinking, we crafted a story around a joke once we had heard. This time the story was relatively simple to draw, so we started the work again.
</p>

<p>The next thing on our task list was to generate a part of one of our shots using line, circle and ellipse drawing algorithms in OpenGL. We chose a drawing that 
can be broken down into simple shapes like lines and circles.
</p>
<p>We have decided on a drawing to draw with OpenGL, but we know nothing about installing and using the APIs and libraries used for doing it. So, we did the obvious 
thing and turned to youtube; we found a few tutorials about installing and using OpenGL. We installed visual studio as our text editor and development platform, and 
we installed glad, glut, glfw libraries for OpenGL. Now, figuring out the coordinates needed to plot our drawing turned out to be another challenge. After doing that, 
the coding part was a bit confusing at first, but after that, it was relatively easy.

We used many reference images for drawing the storyboards; some of those we clicked ourselves and some we found online, this made it a lot easier to visualise the shots 
and to draw them.
